# üåç USGS Earthquake Data Automation Pipeline

## üìò Overview
This project automates the ingestion, validation, transformation, and visualization of **real-time earthquake data** from the [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).  
It was developed as part of my **CMCC Data Automation Midterm Project**.

The pipeline retrieves new earthquake data on a schedule, cleans it, saves it for persistence, and generates an **interactive Plotly dashboard** showing magnitudes over time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Automated Ingestion:** Pulls live GeoJSON data from the USGS feed  
- **Data Cleaning:** Filters and normalizes columns before saving  
- **Storage:** Appends results into `data_store.csv` for long-term tracking  
- **Visualization:** Generates `viz/chart.html` ‚Äî an interactive Plotly chart  
- **Logging:** Every run writes detailed logs in the `logs/` folder  
- **Automation:** Uses CRON (`cron_job.sh`) to schedule recurring runs

## üßæ Midterm Evaluation Summary

**1. Repository Completeness & Documentation:**  
- Full project folder structure included (`src`, `data`, `logs`, `viz`)  
- Clear `README.md` with overview, features, and flow diagram  
- All scripts and configuration files are documented (`run_once.sh`, `cron_job.sh`, `.env.example`, etc.)

**2. Dashboard Evidence:**  
- Interactive Plotly chart generated in `viz/chart.html`  
- Visual proof included (`dashboard_screenshot.png`)  

**3. Operational Logs:**  
- Detailed runtime logs stored in `logs/run_YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.log`  
- Example uploaded: `logs/run_20251026_144904.log`  

**4. Data Persistence Evidence:**  
- Earthquake records stored and appended in `data_store.csv`  
- Confirms data is retained between runs for long-term analysis  

**5. Professionalism & Presentation:**  
- Clean structure, meaningful filenames, clear commit messages
